# quest-to-do

A To-Do website with a gamified twist. It will implement rpg quest like functions and visuals, akin to the interfaces of quests and missions from well known games.

### Users must be able to:
* Create Questlines
* Create individual quests (different from questline)
* Have a main/home interface to see all the pending quests

### I must be able to implement:
* A linked list type class for questlines (changed to arrays for simplicity)

## TO DO
* Add a color palette (thematic)
* Find a way to store and manage the array holding the data
